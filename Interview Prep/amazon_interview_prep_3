Metrics 
Q.1 What are some key metrics you would track for an e-commerce retail business?
Customer metrics: Conversion rate, Average Order Value (AOV), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and Repeat Purchase Rate.
Product metrics: Sell-through rate, Return rate, and Gross Margin by product.
Operational metrics: Inventory turnover, Fulfillment rate, and Order delivery TAT.
Marketing metrics: CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), CTR, and ROAS.
These help identify what’s driving performance across funnels—from acquisition to retention—and optimize accordingly.

Conversion Rate = (Number of Purchases / Number of Visitors) × 100
AOV = Total Revenue / Number of Orders
CLV = AOV × Purchase Frequency × Average Customer Lifespan
Repeat Purchase Rate = (Number of Returning Customers / Total Customers) × 100
Sell-Through Rate = (Units Sold / Units Received) × 100
Return Rate = (Number of Units Returned / Number of Units Sold) × 100
Gross Margin = (Selling Price - Cost of Goods Sold) / Selling Price × 100
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
Fulfillment Rate = (Orders Fulfilled / Orders Placed) × 100
Order Delivery TAT (Turnaround Time)
CAC = Total Marketing Spend / Number of New Customers Acquired
CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100
ROAS = Revenue from Ads / Cost of Ads

Q.2  How would you analyze a sudden drop in sales for a specific category?
Structure: Trend comparison → Segmentation → Funnel metrics → External factors.

First, I’d compare sales trends week-over-week and month-over-month for that category. Then I’d segment by key dimensions like product, geography, channel, and customer type.
I’d check related funnel metrics: Has traffic dropped? Has conversion dipped? Is there higher cart abandonment?
I'd also explore operational metrics like out-of-stock rates or pricing changes. 
If nothing internal explains the drop, I’d consider external factors like seasonality, competitor pricing, or economic trends.

Q.3 What metrics would you use to evaluate the performance of a retail store?
Sales per sq. ft.
Footfall vs. Conversion Rate: Conversion Rate = (Transactions / Footfall) × 100
Average Transaction Value (ATV): ATV = Total Sales / Number of Transactions
Units per Transaction (UPT)
Stock Turnover Ratio
Employee performance metrics like Sales per Associate
Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) if available: CSAT = (Number of Satisfied Responses / Total Responses) × 100

Q.4  How would you prioritize product categories for a discount campaign?
I’d start by analyzing inventory levels, margin profiles, and recent sales trends. Products with high inventory and low velocity could be good discount candidates.
I’d also look at price elasticity, seasonality, and customer purchase behavior.
For strategic decisions, I’d focus discounts on:
High-margin products to boost revenue
Entry-level SKUs that can drive first purchase
Bundling complementary products to increase basket size
All while balancing profitability and long-term CLV.

Q.5 What metrics would you monitor to evaluate customer loyalty?
Repeat Purchase Rate
Customer Lifetime Value
Churn Rate
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
Time between purchases
