TOPIC 1: METRICS 
Q.1 What are some key metrics you would track for an e-commerce retail business?
Customer metrics: Conversion rate, Average Order Value (AOV), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and Repeat Purchase Rate.
Product metrics: Sell-through rate, Return rate, and Gross Margin by product.
Operational metrics: Inventory turnover, Fulfillment rate, and Order delivery TAT.
Marketing metrics: CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), CTR, and ROAS.
These help identify what’s driving performance across funnels—from acquisition to retention—and optimize accordingly.

Conversion Rate = (Number of Purchases / Number of Visitors) × 100
AOV = Total Revenue / Number of Orders
CLV = AOV × Purchase Frequency × Average Customer Lifespan
Repeat Purchase Rate = (Number of Returning Customers / Total Customers) × 100
Sell-Through Rate = (Units Sold / Units Received) × 100
Return Rate = (Number of Units Returned / Number of Units Sold) × 100
Gross Margin = (Selling Price - Cost of Goods Sold) / Selling Price × 100
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
Fulfillment Rate = (Orders Fulfilled / Orders Placed) × 100
Order Delivery TAT (Turnaround Time)
CAC = Total Marketing Spend / Number of New Customers Acquired
CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100
ROAS = Revenue from Ads / Cost of Ads

Q.2  How would you analyze a sudden drop in sales for a specific category?
Structure: Trend comparison → Segmentation → Funnel metrics → External factors.

First, I’d compare sales trends week-over-week and month-over-month for that category. Then I’d segment by key dimensions like product, geography, channel, and customer type.
I’d check related funnel metrics: Has traffic dropped? Has conversion dipped? Is there higher cart abandonment?
I'd also explore operational metrics like out-of-stock rates or pricing changes. 
If nothing internal explains the drop, I’d consider external factors like seasonality, competitor pricing, or economic trends.

Q.3 What metrics would you use to evaluate the performance of a retail store?
Sales per sq. ft.
Footfall vs. Conversion Rate: Conversion Rate = (Transactions / Footfall) × 100
Average Transaction Value (ATV): ATV = Total Sales / Number of Transactions
Units per Transaction (UPT)
Stock Turnover Ratio
Employee performance metrics like Sales per Associate
Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) if available: CSAT = (Number of Satisfied Responses / Total Responses) × 100

Q.4  How would you prioritize product categories for a discount campaign?
I’d start by analyzing inventory levels, margin profiles, and recent sales trends. Products with high inventory and low velocity could be good discount candidates.
I’d also look at price elasticity, seasonality, and customer purchase behavior.
For strategic decisions, I’d focus discounts on:
High-margin products to boost revenue
Entry-level SKUs that can drive first purchase
Bundling complementary products to increase basket size
All while balancing profitability and long-term CLV.

Q.5 What metrics would you monitor to evaluate customer loyalty?
Repeat Purchase Rate
Customer Lifetime Value
Churn Rate
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
Time between purchases

TIPS: 
Always start with business context.
Talk through your framework before jumping to metrics.
Use specific, relevant examples.
Quantify where possible.
Think end-to-end: data → analysis → action → impact.

TOPIC 2:REPORTING 
Q.6 What are the key metrics you include in a retail sales performance report?
In a typical retail sales report, I include total sales, sales per sq. ft., footfall vs. conversion rate, ATV, UPT, and stock turnover. 
These give a holistic view of store performance, customer engagement, and inventory efficiency

Q.7 How do you decide which metrics to include in a report?
I first understand the audience and the business problem. For store managers, I’d focus on daily sales, footfall, conversion rates, and stock levels. 
For leadership, I’d prioritize trends, YoY growth, gross margin, and CLV.

Q.8 What tools have you used to build reports or dashboards?
I’ve used Excel for ad hoc analysis and Tableau for interactive dashboards. 
I also use SQL to pull data from our data warehouse, and sometimes Python for automating reporting pipelines.

Q.8 How do you handle discrepancies or missing data in reports?
I start by validating the data source and checking for NULLs or unexpected values. 

Q.9  Tell me about a time you automated a recurring report.

Q.10  How do you ensure reports are easy to interpret by business stakeholders?
I focus on clean design: consistent colors, clear legends. I use filters to let users drill down into what matters to them, 
and I always validate that definitions are consistent with business terms.

Q.11 How would you report on an underperforming store or category? 
I’d start with a comparative view—vs. other stores, same period last year, or plan. Then, I’d break down sales drivers—footfall, conversion rate, AOV, 
stock-outs, etc. I might also look into customer feedback and product returns.
