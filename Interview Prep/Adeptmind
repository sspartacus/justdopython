Q.1 What is Action filter in Tableau? 
It is a dynamic filtering mechanism that allows users to interact with one visualization to filter data in another.

When a user clicks, hovers, or selects data in one sheet (the source), Tableau applies that selection as a 
filter to another sheet (the target) â€” showing only the related data.
