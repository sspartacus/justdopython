PROBLEM SOLVING
Q.1 A product’s sales dropped 20% last month. How would you investigate?
Compare YoY & MoM trends to confirm if the drop is seasonal.
Segment the impact: Which store/region/product/category is driving the decline?
Identify levers: Review pricing, promotions, inventory levels, competitor activity.
Analyze customer behavior: Lower traffic, reduced basket size, or lower conversion

Q.2 A dashboard you built is showing unexpected results. What do you do?
I’d first validate the data source—check if upstream pipelines or tables changed. Then, I’d check filters, joins, and calculations in the dashboard logic. 
If data is correct, I’d document anomalies and consult with stakeholders to align on expectations

Q.3 A key stakeholder is unhappy with your report saying it doesn't give them insights. What do you do?
I’d set up a call to understand what decisions they’re trying to make and what information they feel is missing. 
Then I’d iterate the report—maybe simplify visuals, add filters, or refocus KPIs—based on their feedback

Q.4 You’re given a messy dataset. How do you approach cleaning it?
I’d start by profiling the data: checking for nulls, outliers, data types, and duplicates. I’d define business rules—e.g., valid date ranges, 
known categories—to filter or impute missing values. Documentation is key, especially for assumptions made.

Q.5 How would you estimate the size of the online grocery market in India
Let’s assume India’s population is ~1.4B. Assume 30% are active internet users who shop online = 420M. Of these, 
maybe 20% buy groceries online = 84M. Average monthly spend = ₹1K → ₹12K/year → Total market = ₹1 Trillion+

Q.6 If you had to increase in-store conversion by 10%, how would you approach it?
I’d begin with funnel metrics: Footfall → Engagement → Transactions. I’d analyze:
Store layout/merchandising
Associate performance
Promotions/offers
Stock availability
Then, I’d run A/B tests to validate ideas, e.g., product placement or offer types.”

TIPS: 
Think Aloud: Don’t jump to solutions; explain your approach step by step.
Use Frameworks: Like Funnel, 5 Whys, Root Cause Tree, etc.
Quantify When Possible: Numbers make your analysis impactful.
Balance Technical & Business View: It’s not just SQL, it’s insight.
End With a Recommendation: What action should the business take?
