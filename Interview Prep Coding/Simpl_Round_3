| Method         | Efficiency                      | Notes                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **INNER JOIN** | ✅ Best for most RDBMS           | Fast with proper indexing          |
| **INTERSECT**  | ✅ Efficient but limited support | Cleaner syntax, removes duplicates |
| **EXISTS**     | ✅ Efficient with large `TableA` | Good alternative to joins          |
| **IN**         | ❌ Slower on large `TableB`      | Avoid if possible                  |
| **MAX**        | ✅ Most Efficient
