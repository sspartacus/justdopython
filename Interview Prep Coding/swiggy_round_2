Q.5 Statistics
1) what is Mean median and mode 
2) When will you use median as compare to mean ? 
1. Data is skewed 
2. Outliers
3. Ordinal Data 

3) Ways to detect outliers 
4) What is hypothesis testing ? 
5) What is null hypothesis? 
A null hypothesis asserts that the two variables have no statistically significant relationship. It aims to disprove the hypothesis; for example, 
Little Susie's null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the growth of a flower based on what type of water you use to water it. 
6) What is postitive or  right skewness ? 
Mean > Median> Mode 

7) What is normal distribution
