Q.2
Find the total transaction volume happnened in each quarter for each alogoritm? 
Ans 
select algorithm, 
TRUNCATE(sum(case when quarter(dt) = 1  then volume end),6) as transactions_Q1, 
TRUNCATE(sum(case when quarter(dt) = 2  then volume end),6) as transactions_Q2, 
TRUNCATE(sum(case when quarter(dt) = 3  then volume end),6) as transactions_Q3, 
TRUNCATE(sum(case when quarter(dt) = 4 then volume end),6) as transactions_Q4

from transactions as t 
left join coins c on t.coin_code = c.code 
WHERE  YEAR(dt) = 2020
group by algorithm 
ORDER BY algorithm

),

    FROM daily_logs
    WHERE WEEKDAY(log_date) IN (5, 6)
)
SELECT 
    emp_id,
    ROUND(SUM(hours_worked), 2) AS total_weekend_hours
FROM weekend_logs
GROUP BY emp_id
ORDER BY total_weekend_hours DESC;
